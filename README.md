# Object Instance Segmentation with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates how to perform object segmentin using YOLOv8 with custom data. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time object detection and segmentation.

## FYI 
- This notebook is prepared by me in Google Collab using free t4 gpu.
- I uploaded the data on Google Drive and used it by mounting the drive into the collab.
- I have downloaded the bubble dataset from roboflow `https://universe.roboflow.com/indian-institute-of-technology-guwahati/project-2-cylun/dataset/2/download`
- The sample train images from bubble dataset
